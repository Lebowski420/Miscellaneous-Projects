# Arduino Touch Matrix
After a personal request, I decided to upload the code for this project, but you must keep in mind that this code is 3 years old and bulky. If you have the time to optimise it and to make it look good, be sure to hit the repository a pull request. I hope it's going to help some people that are still interested in the project.

### Directory Structure:
* MatrixInput is the folder where the C# / WPF project is stored
* touch.ino is the arduino code
