### Arduino Touch Matrix

A simple 3x3 touch matrix that is connected to a C# program - great for using it as hotkeys. If you have time, maybe implement some protocol to communicate with Adobe softwares, that would be very interesting. Link to the Youtube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ-kKMGB200).

### Expand Effect in C#

GUI Effect that uses simple math to make it look as if the window is expanding.

### Out-dated Ripple Effect on a WPF button using animation control

Just use Material UI for WPF. Don't bother with this shit.
